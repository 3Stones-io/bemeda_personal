# Bemeda Platform Documentation - Unified Structure

## 🎯 Overview

This documentation site has been reorganized into a **unified feature-based structure** that connects all participant perspectives (Business Analysis, UX/UI Design, Testing, and Technical Implementation) into a single, coherent system.

## 🏗️ New Structure

### **1. Unified Feature Table** (`/unified-table/`)
- **Single source of truth** for all platform features
- **Progress tracking** across all participant domains
- **Filterable view** by status, progress, and feature type
- **Cross-references** between related features and components

### **2. Feature-Based Organization** (`/features/`)
Each feature has its own directory with four participant perspectives:

```
features/
├── job-search-discovery/          # F001 - Job Search & Discovery
│   ├── business/                  # Nicole's Business Analysis
│   ├── design/                    # Oghogho's UX/UI Design
│   ├── testing/                   # Dejan's Testing & QA
│   └── technical/                 # Almir's Technical Implementation
├── user-profiles/                 # F002 - User Profiles & Resume Builder
├── application-management/         # F003 - Application Management
├── communication/                  # F004 - Communication & Messaging
├── job-posting-tools/             # F005 - Job Posting & Employer Tools
├── contract-management/            # F006 - Contract & Offer Management
└── platform-infrastructure/       # F007 - Platform Infrastructure
```

### **3. Participant Domains** (`/participants/`)
Maintains the existing participant-focused structure for specialized work:

```
participants/
├── scenarios/                      # Nicole - Business Analysis
├── ux-ui/                         # Oghogho - User Experience
├── testing/                       # Dejan - Quality Engineering
└── features/                      # Almir - Technical Lead
```

## 🔗 Navigation Flow

1. **Main Dashboard** → **Unified Feature Table** → **Individual Feature Pages**
2. **Feature Pages** → **Participant-Specific Content** → **Cross-References**
3. **Participant Domains** → **Specialized Work Areas** → **Feature Integration**

## 📊 Benefits of New Structure

### **For Team Communication**
- **Single source of truth** for feature status
- **Clear ownership** assignment for each component
- **Cross-references** show dependencies and relationships
- **Progress tracking** across all domains

### **For Development Workflow**
- **Feature-focused** organization matches development sprints
- **Participant perspectives** remain clearly separated
- **Integration points** are explicitly documented
- **Status visibility** prevents misalignment

### **For Documentation Maintenance**
- **Centralized updates** reduce duplication
- **Consistent structure** across all features
- **Easy navigation** between related content
- **Scalable architecture** for future features

## 🚀 Implementation Status

- ✅ **Phase 1**: Directory structure created
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Unified table implemented
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Sample feature page created
- 🔄 **Phase 4**: Content migration in progress
- 📋 **Phase 5**: Cross-references and links to be updated

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

### **For Feature Updates**
1. Update the **unified table** first
2. Modify **feature-specific content** in `/features/`
3. Update **participant domain content** as needed
4. Ensure **cross-references** remain accurate

### **For New Features**
1. Create feature directory in `/features/`
2. Add to **unified table**
3. Create participant perspective subdirectories
4. Update **cross-references** in related features

### **For Content Organization**
- **Business logic** goes in `/features/{feature}/business/`
- **Design assets** go in `/features/{feature}/design/`
- **Testing documentation** goes in `/features/{feature}/testing/`
- **Technical specs** go in `/features/{feature}/technical/`

## 🔍 Quick Start

1. **View Overview**: Start at `/unified-table/` for complete feature status
2. **Explore Features**: Click on any feature to see all participant perspectives
3. **Navigate Domains**: Use participant directories for specialized work
4. **Find Dependencies**: Check cross-references for related content

## 📞 Support

For questions about the new structure or implementation:
- **Structure Design**: Review this README and the unified table
- **Content Migration**: Check existing participant directories
- **Feature Updates**: Follow the usage guidelines above
- **Technical Issues**: Review the feature page templates
