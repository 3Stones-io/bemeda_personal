## Design Methodology

### Architecture Principles

#### 1. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

- Clear separation between Vermittlung and Verleih domains
- Bounded contexts for each business capability
- Ubiquitous language aligned with Swiss employment terminology

#### 2. **Context-Driven Architecture**

- Context-based design with clear domain boundaries
- Independent deployability and scalability within Phoenix monolith
- Elixir/OTP supervision trees for failure isolation and resilience

#### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**

- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- Event sourcing for audit trails and compliance
- Real-time updates and notifications

#### 4. **Security by Design**

- Zero-trust security model
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Privacy by design for GDPR/DSG compliance

### Design Validation Framework

#### Architecture Review Process

1. **Technical Review**: Engineering team architecture assessment
2. **Security Review**: Security team threat modeling and assessment
3. **Compliance Review**: Legal team regulatory requirement validation
4. **Performance Review**: Load testing and scalability validation
5. **Stakeholder Review**: Business team alignment and approval

#### Design Quality Metrics

- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns and bounded contexts
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability demonstration
- **Maintainability**: Code organization and documentation quality
- **Testability**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing coverage
- **Observability**: Monitoring, logging, and debugging capabilities
