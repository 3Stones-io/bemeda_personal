- Failure isolation and resilience patterns
- Technology diversity where appropriate

#### 3. **Event-Driven Architecture**
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
- Event sourcing for audit trails and compliance
- Real-time updates and notifications

#### 4. **Security by Design**
- Zero-trust security model
- Defense in depth with multiple security layers
- Privacy by design for GDPR/DSG compliance

### Design Validation Framework

#### Architecture Review Process
1. **Technical Review**: Engineering team architecture assessment
2. **Security Review**: Security team threat modeling and assessment
3. **Compliance Review**: Legal team regulatory requirement validation
4. **Performance Review**: Load testing and scalability validation
5. **Stakeholder Review**: Business team alignment and approval

#### Design Quality Metrics
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns and bounded contexts
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability demonstration
- **Maintainability**: Code organization and documentation quality
