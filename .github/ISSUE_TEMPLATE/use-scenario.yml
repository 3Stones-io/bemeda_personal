        ## üéØ USE Scenario Definition Template
        
        Create executable USE (Unified Scenario Engineering) scenarios with clear actor interactions.
        **Built on BDD foundation with business-friendly language.**
        
        USE scenarios use Given-When-Then format but focus on:
        - **Actors**: Who is involved (Business, Technical, UX)
        - **Scenarios**: What happens between actors  
        - **Domains**: B_S (Business), T_S (Technical), U_S (UX)
