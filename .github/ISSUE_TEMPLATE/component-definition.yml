        ## üìã USE Component Definition Template
        
        **USE (Unified Scenario Engineering)** extends BDD with business-friendly language.
        This template ensures your USE component is properly indexed and managed.
        **All fields marked with * are required for automated processing.**
        
        üí° **USE vs BDD**: We use USE terminology (Scenarios, Actors, Domains) but implement with proven BDD tools.
